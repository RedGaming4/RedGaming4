🖥️ Tech Enthusiast | 🏎️ Race Car Driver | 💻 Full-Stack Developer

👨‍💻 About Me

Hey! I'm Emilio Laurenti, a 20-year-old tech lover who’s been programming since 7th grade! My journey started with a TI-84 calculator (yep, that’s right! 😄) where I learned how to code Pong directly on the calculator itself! Little me didn't realize you could actually connect it to a computer. 😂

Ever since then, I’ve been hooked on everything tech-related, and I love exploring all areas of tech:


💻 Programming (any language, you name it!)
🔧 Hardware & IT
🛡️ Cybersecurity
🌐 Networking


If it's tech, I'm fascinated by it! I'm currently working on my portfolio website where I’ll be showcasing some of my coolest projects, so stay tuned for that! 🚀

🏎️ When I’m Not Coding...

When I’m not immersed in the world of tech, you’ll find me out on the track!
I’m a race car driver 🏁 and love go-karting on the weekends—it’s my favorite way to get the adrenaline pumping. Speeding down the track is a perfect complement to my fast-paced tech life. 😎

🔥 Current Projects
Here's what I’m currently working on:

🌐 Personal Portfolio Website – Showcasing all my projects.

🤖 AI Projects – Implementing AWS Rekognition for advanced image recognition.

🛠️ Home Lab – Setting up servers, networking gear, and experimenting with cybersecurity.

🖱️ My Own Gaming Mouse – Designing hardware and writing custom drivers.

👾 My Own Interpreter/Language – Building my own programming language from scratch.

🌐 Setting Up My Own HTTP Web Server – Learning server configurations and hosting.

And more 🎉
